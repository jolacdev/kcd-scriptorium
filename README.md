## üì¶ Installation

Scriptorium is fully portable, so no installation required.

There are two builds available:

- **`scriptorium.exe` (~80 MB)**
  A standalone executable with Node.js embedded. Runs out-of-the-box.

- **`scriptorium.cjs` (~0.5 MB)**
  A bundled CommonJS file that requires **Node.js 22+** installed on your system.

üí° **Tip:** Place and run Scriptorium in its own folder. This folder will be used to store:

- `scriptorium-settings.json`: auto-generated config file with your setup options.
- `Scriptorium/*`: the mod folder containing all generated mod files.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility & Limitations

- **Partial Translation**
  This mod does **not** provide complete translations. Some texts cannot be dual-rendered due to technical limitations, including UI wrappers, spacing/overflow issues, untranslated official text, or untested files.

- **Language Support**
  Dual language can be applied to **any language paired with English**, with configurable order (e.g., _English‚ÄìSpanish_ or _Spanish‚ÄìEnglish_). After building the mod, Scriptorium will indicate which in-game language to select.

- **Tested Languages and Known Issues**
  The mod has been **moderately tested** for **English ‚Üî Spanish**. Other Latin-based languages should work similarly, but Asian languages (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, etc.) have not been tested.

  Note that when using dual language, some texts may appear overlapped or misaligned. Please report any issues so they can be addressed where possible.
